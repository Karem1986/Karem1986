### This is a little bit more about me:

I was born in Ecuador, where sweet pineapples grow and you can dance salsa even on the street and everyone else would join you!
When I was 16 years old, I moved to Spain with a relative, but shortly after, at 17 I had to move out and start to live independently.
Since then, I worked and studied, moved to England and found in coding my passion after building my WordPress website... and the rest is history.
Right now, I am based in the Netherlands and looking for a junior web developer role :)
