### This is a little bit more about me:

⏯️ - I was born in Ecuador, where sweet pineapples grow and you can dance salsa even on the street and everyone else would join you!
⏯️ - When I was 16 years old, I moved to Spain with a relative and shortly after, at 17 I had to move out and start to live independently.
⏯️ - Since then, I moved to England when I was 26 and found in coding my passion after building my WordPress website... and the rest is history.
⏯️ - Currently, I am based in the Netherlands and looking for a junior web developer role :)
