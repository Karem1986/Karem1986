### This is a little bit more about me:

- Born in Ecuador, where sweet pineapples grow, you can dance salsa even on the street and everyone else would join!
- I moved to Europe, Spain with 16 years old. At 17 years old I started to live independently and achieved to become a EU citizen. 
- In 2018, found my passion: developing after building my first WordPress website, which led me to study a masters in Marketing.
- Currently,based in the Netherlands and looking for a junior Software Engineer job. I am an avid, fast learner:)
